1. I dont know about the local space in JavaScript... And i wanted to add and remove
cards .... And initially i was trying with simple div which was very complicated 
Then i asked my friend how was good at webdevelepment about the issue. Then he told
me about this.

2.Also while using localStorage i faced many difficulties,like  i thought localStorage is an array but i was not a string.
 And i though it would be cleared automatically when i closed the browser but i was 
wrong.

3.Also after doing this project i was comfortable with javaScript...
